# root_growth_cv
This is a computer vision project involved in modelling root growth

# Description:

Tree root growth dynamics are not well understood even though they are
a key element in the carbon cycle of forested ecosystems. In order to
monitor tree root growth, we installed normal office scanner
belowground and took thousands of daily images. The goal is to
automatically analyse daily root length (and/or root area) in the
images and to calculate daily root growth.
