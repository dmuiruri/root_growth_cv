# Root Growth

This is a computer vision project that inolves modelling root growth
based on images. Root images were obtained from an installed normal
office scanner belowground where thousands of daily images are
taken. Ref: The Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research
(INAR), Finland


Tree root growth dynamics are not well understood even though they are
a key element in the carbon cycle of forested ecosystems. In order to
monitor tree root growth, The goal of this project is to automatically
analyse daily root length (and/or root area) in the images and to
calculate daily root growth.
